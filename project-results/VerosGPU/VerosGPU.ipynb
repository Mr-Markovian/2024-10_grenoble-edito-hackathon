    "##### What is Veros ?\n",
    "Veros is the VERsatile Ocean Simulator. It's a ocean model written all in python with the framework JAX. It's able to run global ocean models and also regional models. JAX is a framework that replace numpy to make python work on GPU with good performances and that allows automatic differentiations. Veros allows to chose a backend in numpy (with a CPU) and JAX (with a GPU)."

    "We worked on the `jupyter-gpu` service of the Datalab with the allocation of 1 GPU. We were able to install JAX and the Veros model on a conda environment. But unfortunately, we couldn't manage to make complex model runs. We tried 1° model, 4° model and north atlantic regional model, and every time the computation crashed on the plateform cause of the lack of computing ressources, whether using CPU or GPU. Maybe because we were a lot connexted at the same time to the plateform."
