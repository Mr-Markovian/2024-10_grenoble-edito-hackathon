## Title 
TurbidityMapping

## Short description of the project 
Integrate Inference for pretrained 4DVarNet-based Turbidity Mapping pipe line, including predicting, evaluation metrics and visualiations

## Expected benefit of the project
Other partners of EDITO ModelLab to use our method for their applications
 
## Datasets
- Dataset is provided by CMEMS services, it is also uploaded on EDITO cloud
- A pretrained weight is uploaded on EDITO cloud as well

## Codebase
Description of the software packages that will be used (with links to github repos): https://github.com/nguyenthuynga/4dvarnet-starter

## Compute resources 
4DVarNet is relatively costly, we estimate a GPU  

## People involved 
List of people involved: Fabio, Minh, Nga, Shashank
