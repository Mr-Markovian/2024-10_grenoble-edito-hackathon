# Hackathon project

## Title 
SSH and tracer correlation (Forecast Metric)

## Short description of the project 
Finding correlation between SSH and tracers(SST, Salinity, ...)
This metric could be applied to XiHe, 4DVarNet, ...

## Expected benefit of the project
Evaluation of model dynamics and variable correlations

## Datasets
Model reconstruction of SSH and a tracer variable

## Codebase
OpenSource metrics codebases exists on multiple githubs:
- https://jaxparrow.readthedocs.io/

## Compute resources 
basic metrics oftentimes require only a CPU to run

## People involved 
Anass El Aouni
Anne Durif
Pierre Hasl√©e
