## Title 
Impact of L4 SHH Products on Lagrangian Drift Assessed on the EDITO Platform (ILSP-LDAE)

## Short description of the project 
Observe how different L4 mapping products (DUACS, MIOST, VarDyn, 4dVarNet) of SSH affect the dispersion and accuracy of
reconstructed trajectory ensembles of ocean surface drifters. Focusing on one ensemble at first and derive statistics from several
ensembles if time allows it. 

## Expected benefit of the project
Provide open-source and reproducible comparison pipeline. Easily include additional L4 mapping methods (NeurOST) or lagrangian simulators.

## Datasets
Global Drifter Program ; DUACS, MIOST, VarDyn, 4dVarNet. Uploaded to the EDITO cloud.

## Codebase
OceanParcels: https://github.com/OceanParcels/parcels. And maybe some other simulators.

## Compute resources 
A few CPUs will be enough when working on a single ensemble, a GPU will be necessary to reconstruct a large number of ensembles.

## People involved 
Daria Botvynko, Vadim Bertrand
